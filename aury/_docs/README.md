# Aury

Aury is a framework to create visual novels.

# Aury in a nutshell

Aury thinks a visual novel like a theater play.
You got characters, a location and scenes. Everything goes inside episodes.

The flow of the novel changes every time that you add dialogs or change the location the timeline of the scene add a milestone. Now you must play the milestone.
